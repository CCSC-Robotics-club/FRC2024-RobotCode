***


### Problem Description
The way swerve wheels work is that they always turn to face the driving direction.

Now, imagine this scenario: if the pilot pushes the control stick forward.

The Wheels are going to, ofcourse, face forward.

All of a sudden, the pilot pushes the control stick backwards

For a WPILib-powered Swerve, the wheels will turn 180 degrees around to face the new direction.

While a Swerve Module Powered with our swerve-lib will just reverse the wheel.

##### Explain how the student embodies the philosophies of Gracious Professionalism® and Coopertition® through the FIRST Core Values: Discovery, Innovation, Impact, Inclusion, Teamwork and Fun. Please provide examples.
Yiran Liu (Sam), epitomizes the above in significant ways. One example is his dedication to learning and excelling in robotics, which enabled him to become the chief programmer and the team leader.  As the most frequently-appearing member of our team, Sam spends four hour a day on average in the trainin base, which bassically is all the free time a student has in our school.  Additionally,  he attended a summer camp at Carnegie Mellon University during his vaccation, where he learned from experienced team members from team 3504 "Girls of Steel" and team 4467 "Titanium Titans". 

Beyond this, Sam has been organizing serveral activities to help publicize our team.  For instance, he organized a fund-raising event last month during the PTA meeting of our school.  FRC robots were coded to dance on the playground to draw parents' attentions.  In the end we recieved a total of 2600 RMB.

##### How has the student increased the awareness of FIRST? Describe the student’s interests and/or plans to continue to engage with FIRST beyond high school. Please provide examples.

As a result of the cancellation of FRC events during the pandamic, many teams in Shenzhen are in hard times of transition.  Sam is actively helping them out.  Team members and mentors from team 6414 "Voyager", team 8812 and team 6706 "Golem" often come to our training base, seeking to learn. In respond, Sam opened our github repositories to them and shared his experiences. 

Sam is also planning to do a summer project facing students from local high schools after finishing his last competition in 2025. Inspired by his experiences in the summer camp at CMU, Sam intends to aim his project not only to teaching skills, but also igniting his students' passion for STEAM fields. This demnstrates his commitment to spreading the awareness of FIRST beyond his immediate community. 

##### How does the student's individual contribution to the team benefit the team as a whole? Please provide examples.

Sam benefits his team mainly through his outstanding efforts in programming. His innovative ideas in software development greatly enhance the team's technical prowess and competitiveness in competitions. For instance, he is currently working on a vision-guided auto driving function for this year's FRC robot, allowing the pilot to make complex movements with just one click of a button.  When he does programming, he never ask himself "How can I get my job done?", he instead would ask "What else can I do to make the pilot's life easier?".

Additionally, Sam is actively working on retraining the new programmers.  Different from the way programming is taught in classrooms, Sam focused more on practice. He helps students gain experiences through hands-on operations like running codes on Robots from previous years.

##### Describe the students' experience in areas of STEM. This could include but is not limited to skills in engineering, software, CAD, fabrication, etc. Please provide examples.

Sam's fabulous talent and extensive experience in programming enabled him to quickly adapt to the challenges of coding for robots.  His innovative ideas, coupled with incredibly abundant knowledges have made him an impactable programmer. This is widnessed not just by me, but also other teams in Shenzhen. Mr.Wu, the mentor of "Golem", was deeply shocked by the fact that Sam wrote his chassis code down from linear algreba and PID algorithms, without implementing any external libraries from WPI.  He calls it "amazing work that perfassional software engineers would struggle to complete". 
This year, Sam started working on vision application right after the rules were revealed.  And just in two weeks have he managed already to detect AprilTag and Notes, as well as measuring their precise distance. 


##### Explain the student’s leadership to their fellow team members. How do they motivate others? What is their leadership style? Please provide examples.

Sam's leadership within the team is characterized by motivation and dedication, setting a positive example for fellow team members.  His hardworking nature serves as a role model for team members.  For example, he is almost in present every day during the winter vaccation, which have led to active participation of many other members.

Also, Sam is actively developing innovative methods in management.  For instance, he introduced the "task board" as his unique tool of managing. He keeps track of the macroscopic goals of the whole team on the top board, while each individual member labels their plans below.  By clearly outlining goals and responsibilities, the tool motivates others to stay focused and accountable, fostering a collaborative and efficient work environment.  

##### Please share anything else you would like us to know about the student, including academic performance, specialized skills, or additional extracurricular activities. (this one only 500 characters)

While Sam dedicated most of his time to Robotics, he managed to completed his academic cirriculums in a satisfying level. He passed all three AP exams in Physics, Calculus and Ecnomics, all in scores of 5.  As to English learning, Sam is the first student in his grade who accompished an overall score of 7.5 in IELTS test.  
This year, Sam is moving to participate in 6 additional AP courses, and his performances in simulation tests give us no doubt that he can pass the exams.

##### How long has the student been involved in FIRST? (30 words max)

For 1 year and 4 months.


hello! I am the mentor of an FRC team in Shenzhen, I nominated one of my students as a dean's list candidate, and wrote an essay. However, the essay may have grammar or spelling mistakes,  can you help me correct them?  Also, feel free to make changes to my word choices or expressions if you have a better of saying them.  Try not to write too long, as there is an 800 characters (letters and punctuations) length constrain. Do not add/remove any content from/to my passage. I will feed you with my writing in a moment, now just tell me if you understand my requirements

##### Explain how the student embodies the philosophies of Gracious Professionalism® and Coopertition® through the FIRST Core Values: Discovery, Innovation, Impact, Inclusion, Teamwork and Fun. Please provide examples.

Yiran Liu (Sam) exemplifies these qualities in significant ways. One example is his dedication to learning and excelling in robotics, leading him to become the chief programmer and team leader. As the most frequently-appearing member of our team, Sam devotes around four hours daily to training, using all his available free time. Additionally, he attended a summer camp at Carnegie Mellon University, learning from experienced team members from teams 3504 and 4467.

Furthermore, Sam organizes various activities to promote our team. For example, he arranged a fundraising event last month during our school's PTA meeting. On which FRC robots were coded to performed a dance to attract parents' attention, resulting in a total of 2600 RMB raised.

##### How has the student increased the awareness of FIRST? Describe the student’s interests and/or plans to continue to engage with FIRST beyond high school. Please provide examples.

Due to the cancellation of FRC events during the pandemic, many teams in Shenzhen face challenges. Sam actively assists them, collaborating with team members and mentors from Team 6414 “Voyager,” Team 6706 “Golem,” and Team 8812 at our training base. Sam generously shares his experiences and opens our GitHub repositories to them. He has even designed a robot configurator, enabling teams with distinct chassis setups to utilize the same codebase.

Moreover, Sam has ambitious plans for a summer project aimed at local high school students after his final competition in 2025. Inspired by the CMU summer camp, he intends to teach essential skills to newcomers from other teams, igniting their passion for STEAM fields. Sam embodies the FIRST spirit, even beyond the conclusion of his active career with our team.

##### How does the student's individual contribution to the team benefit the team as a whole? Please provide examples.

Sam significantly benefits the team through his exceptional programming efforts. His innovative ideas in software development elevate the team’s technical prowess and enhance our competitiveness in competitions. For instance, he is currently developing a vision-guided auto-driving function for this year’s FRC robot. With just one click of a button, the pilot can execute complex movements seamlessly. When programming, Sam doesn’t merely ask himself, “How can I complete my task?” Instead, he consistently considers, “What else can I do to simplify the pilot’s experience?”

Furthermore, Sam actively contributes to retraining new programmers. Unlike traditional classroom approaches, Sam emphasizes practical learning. He guides students through hands-on operations, such as running code on robots from previous years, ensuring they gain valuable experience.

##### Describe the students' experience in areas of STEM. This could include but is not limited to skills in engineering, software, CAD, fabrication, etc. Please provide examples.

Sam’s remarkable talent and extensive programming experience allow him to swiftly adapt to the challenges of coding for robots. His innovative ideas, combined with a wealth of knowledge, make him an exceptional programmer. This is evident not only to me but also to other teams in Shenzhen. Mr. Wu, the mentor of team ‘Golem,’ was profoundly impressed when Sam wrote his chassis code using linear algebra and PID algorithms, without relying on any external libraries from WPI. Mr. Wu described it as ‘amazing work that professional software engineers would find challenging to complete.’

This year, Sam wasted no time and immediately delved into vision applications after the rules were revealed. In just two weeks, he successfully developed the capability to detect AprilTags and notes, as well as accurately measure their distances.

##### Explain the student’s leadership to their fellow team members. How do they motivate others? What is their leadership style? Please provide examples.

Sam’s leadership within the team is characterized by motivation and unwavering dedication, setting a positive example for fellow team members. His tireless work ethic serves as a role model, inspiring others to give their best. For instance, during winter vacation, Sam is almost always present, which has encouraged active participation from many other team members.

Additionally, Sam actively pioneers innovative management methods. He introduced the “task board” as a unique tool for organizing team activities. On the top board, he tracks the team’s macroscopic goals, while each individual member labels their specific plans below. This clear delineation of goals and responsibilities motivates everyone to stay focused, accountable, and fosters a collaborative and efficient work environment.

##### Please share anything else you would like us to know about the student, including academic performance, specialized skills, or additional extracurricular activities. (this one only 500 characters)

Despite dedicating most of his time to Robotics, Sam has managed to excel in his academic pursuits. He passed all three AP exams in Physics, Calculus, and Economics, each with a perfect score of 5. As to English proficiency, Sam stands out as the first student in his grade to achieve an overall score of 7.5 in IELTS.

This year, Sam is participating in six additional AP courses, and his performance in simulation tests leaves no doubt that he will excel in these exams as well.
